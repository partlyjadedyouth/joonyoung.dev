**[ISCHIVE.com](https://ischive.com)** is a website designed to archive the coursework submitted by students in the Dept. of Information Science, Seoul National University. It also works as a digital brochure of **assignment exhibition**, which is the department's biggest event.

I started this project with my colleagues and the official support of the department in December 2022. After about six months of planning, design, and development, the testing began with the first semester's assignment exhibition in 2023.

After some migration in the tech stacks, the website finally started to be in use with the second semester's exhibition in 2024.
