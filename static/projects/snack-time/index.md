Did you know that turtles are one of the most endangered species in the world? In this serious game, you can experience life as a turtle in the ocean, eating jellyfish while avoiding plastic bags. The game is designed to raise awareness of the importance of protecting turtles and the ocean.

Before developing this game, I had literally **no experience and knowledge in C# and Unity.** However, I was able to develop this game in a week with just the support of ChatGPT. Of course, the game has a lot to be improved, **but developing it solely with AI support was a unique experience ðŸ˜Š.**

This game was submitted as coursework for **Serious Game** course at Seoul National University.
