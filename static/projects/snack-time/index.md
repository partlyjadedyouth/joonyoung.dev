Did you know that turtles are one of the most endangered species in the world? In this serious game, you can experience life as a turtle in the ocean, eating jellyfish while avoiding plastic bags. **Turtle's Snack Time** is designed to raise awareness of the importance of protecting turtles and the ocean.

Before developing this game, I had literally **no experience or knowledge in C# and Unity.** However, I was able to develop this game in a week with the support of ChatGPT. Of course, the game still has a lot of room for improvement, **but developing it solely with AI support was a unique experience ðŸ˜Š.**

While making this game, I learned a lot about **the overall process of game design and development, as well as the unique interactive elements that games can have.** I also realized that games can aim to solve social issues or change players' perceptions, not just be entertaining. This sparked a great interest in the concept of **gamification** for me.

This game was submitted as coursework for the **Serious Game** course at Seoul National University.
