**[ISCHIVE](https://ischive.com)**, which is a combination of **ISC (Information Science & Culture)** and **Archive**, is a website designed to archive the coursework submitted by students in the Dept. of Information Science and Culture Studies, Seoul National University. It also works as a digital brochure of **assignment exhibition**, which is the department's largest event.

**Now, ISCHIVE has become a major platform for students and faculty within and outside of SNU to get to know the department.**

I started this project with my colleagues and official support from the department in December 2022. After six months of planning, design, and development, we piloted the project with the first semester's assignment exhibition in 2023.

After some migration in the tech stacks, the website finally launched for the second semester's exhibition in 2024.

In the first semester of 2024, I recruited new team members to establish sustainable maintenance and handoff processes for the website.

Through this project, I learned **how to develop a fully functional website.** It was also my first time working with a large team on web development, which allowed me to get familiar with **various collaboration tools like Git and Slack.** In the first semester of 2024, **I took on the role of project leader, gaining valuable experience in managing the project and leading the team.**
