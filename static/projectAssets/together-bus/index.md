In Korea, most concerts are held in Seoul, due to the high concentration of people in the metropolitan area. Therefore, people living in rural areas have to spend extra money on transportation and accommodation to attend concerts, which makes them hesitate to do so.

As a result, my colleagues and I designed **a charter bus service** to solve this problem. We conducted market research with **in-depth interviews**, designed **a prototype**, and established **a market entry strategy including a revenue model.** Finally, we presented it through an in-class **IR(Investor Relations) deck**.

Through this project, I was able to experience the entire **'Double Diamond Process'** of user-centered design, which involves discovering and defining problem situations, developing solutions, and delivering them to users. I also learned how to apply **various UX design methodologies to real products.** Additionally, IR deck allowed me to have the new experience of pitching our product to investors.

This design work was submitted as coursework for **User-Centered Design** course at Dept. of Information Science, Seoul National University.
