In Korea, most concerts are held in Seoul, due to the high concentration of people in the metropolitan area. Therefore, people living in rural areas have to spend extra money on transportation and accommodation to attend concerts, which makes them hesitate to do so.

Me and my colleagues designed **a bus charter service** to solve this problem. We conducted market research with interviews, developed a prototype design, and established a market entry strategy with revenue model, and presented it through an IR deck.

This design work was submitted as coursework for User-Centered Design course at Dept. of Information Science, Seoul National University.
